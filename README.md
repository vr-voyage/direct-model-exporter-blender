# Voyage Direct Model Exporter

To be used with the [Direct Model Importer for VRChat](https://github.com/vr-voyage/direct-model-importer-vrchat)

## How to export a Mesh

To export a Mesh with the Addon, select an object and select the menu item :
**Object > (Voyage) Encode active mesh to EXR...**

Then choose where you want to save the resulting EXR file.

Once the file generated, if you want to use it on VRChat, you'll have to upload
it on a webserver reachable through VRChat.
Since Discord file links are accepted and whitelisted by default, I recommend
uploading the file to your private Discord server, and then paste the link
in the VRChat 'Direct Model Importer' panel.

## How to install the Add-on
